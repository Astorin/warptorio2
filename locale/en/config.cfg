warptorio-reactor=The warp reactor is a failed experiment. It's power output is weak and it seems to be pulling itself into an interdimentional rift more than it can draw energy from it. It's unstable too and will destroy the planet it's on if left unmanaged, so try to build a rocket and get away !
